# Credit-modelling-with-machine-learning
In this project we perform a credit modelling with machine learning, which is a common data science problem in the finance sector. The datasaet consists on informations of a group of individuals who took a loan from a bank.
The problem consists in the following: Considering the investor's point of view, we want to avoid people that will default their loan. Create a machine learning model to allow a conservative investor to avoid people that will default on their loans.



This project is separated into 3 parts:
- Data Cleaning, where we take the dataset, process and extract the useful information for the model.
- Feature Engineering, where we prepare the cleaned data to train the model
- Modelling, where we apply the logistic regression (with corrections!) and random forest classifier to the training dataset.
